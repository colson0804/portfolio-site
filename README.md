# Portfolio website 
A personal portfolio website using React, Next.js, and ChakraUI. Adapted from [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSMZgXzC9AA&amp;t=1519s) but customized with my own content.

Future plans involve adding a blog, a gallery, and a projects page to showcase my work. 

## Getting Started 
### Prerequisites 
* NodeJS: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine to run the project and manage dependencies.

### Installation 
1. Clone the repository using Git:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/colson0804/portfolio-site.git
```
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's directory.
3. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`. 
4. Start the development server by running `npm run dev` 
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to preview the portfolio site locally.
